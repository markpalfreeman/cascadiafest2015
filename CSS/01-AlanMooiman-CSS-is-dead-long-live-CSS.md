Old saying: "The King is dead. Long live the King!"

"We declare something dead rather quickly... CSS has been pronounced dead many times."

> Preprocessors saved us from CSS.
> CSS will save us form Preprocessors.

### Preprocessing features with CSS solutions:
- Nesting (can get bloated) -> :matches()
- Flexbox (concerns can be too closely tied) -> CSS Grid Layout
- Variables -> coming to CSS!
- Extends -> Tab Atkins: these may become better in CSS itself
- Web Components... eventually
- @import - > with HTTP/2, we can use these in regular CSS without extra HTTP requests. They even support @media queries!?
  - also, Container Queries.

CSS will be around for a while. It doesn't need to be ditched altogether.

> The King isn't dead; he's just carefully planning what's best for his subjects.
