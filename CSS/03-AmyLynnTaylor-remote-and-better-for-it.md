5 years ago, &yet was in one small office in Richland.
Amy wanted to move to PDX, and from then on, it made an effort to allow remote workers.

Separation challenges arose: most fun was happening back at the office/offline -> how do we maintain togetherness?

### Solutions/findings
- The more connection, the better 
- Frequent video calls

> Our small, non-magical choices add up to a big, magical-feeling workplace.

> Building and maintaining an awesome team is everyone's job.

Go watch Breńe Brown's TED talk on vulnerability.

Really, everyone is "remote." So in any environment, how can we seek connectivity?

1. Put people first
2. Find and focus on the things that unite you (goals, values)
3. Communicate well (with kindness and respect)
4. Connect on a regular basis—more than just at work (peer-to-peer 1-on-1s)
